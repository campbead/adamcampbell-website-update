## Abstract

This study presents a numerical solution for sea-glacier invasion through narrow straits during Snowball Earth events, building on earlier analytical work. The research provides more detailed insights into the potential for nearly-enclosed seas to serve as refugia for surface life during extreme global glaciation events.

## Key Findings

- Developed numerical solutions for sea-glacier invasion through narrow straits
- Enhanced understanding of Snowball Earth dynamics beyond analytical models
- Provided more detailed insights into potential life refugia
- Contributed to the broader understanding of extreme climate events

## Impact

This publication has been cited 9 times and represents an important advancement in numerical modeling of Snowball Earth dynamics.
