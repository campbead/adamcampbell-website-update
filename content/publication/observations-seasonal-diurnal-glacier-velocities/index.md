## Abstract

This study presents observations of seasonal and diurnal glacier velocities at Mount Rainier, Washington, using terrestrial radar interferometry. The research provides insights into the temporal variability of glacier flow and its relationship to environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.

## Key Findings

- Documented seasonal variations in glacier velocity at Mount Rainier
- Identified diurnal velocity patterns related to solar radiation
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of terrestrial radar interferometry for glacier monitoring
- Provided insights into glacier response to environmental forcing

## Impact

This publication has been cited 31 times and represents a significant contribution to understanding glacier dynamics in temperate mountain environments.
