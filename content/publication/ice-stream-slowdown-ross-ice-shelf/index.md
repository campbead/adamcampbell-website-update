## Abstract

This study examines the long-term thinning of the Ross Ice Shelf driven by ice stream slowdown, demonstrating that this process will occur regardless of ocean warming. The research provides important insights into Antarctic ice shelf dynamics and future sea level rise, highlighting the complex interactions between ice streams and ice shelves.

## Key Findings

- Demonstrated that ice stream slowdown will drive Ross Ice Shelf thinning
- Showed this process occurs independently of ocean warming
- Provided insights into long-term Antarctic ice shelf dynamics
- Contributed to understanding of future sea level rise scenarios

## Impact

This publication has been cited 14 times and represents important work in understanding Antarctic ice shelf response to climate change and its implications for global sea level rise.
