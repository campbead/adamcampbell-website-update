## Abstract

This study examines whether promontories could have restricted sea-glacier penetration into marine embayments during Snowball Earth events. The research explores the potential role of coastal geometry in creating refugia for surface life during extreme global glaciation, building on earlier work on Snowball Earth dynamics.

## Key Findings

- Investigated the role of promontories in restricting sea-glacier penetration
- Examined coastal geometry effects on potential life refugia
- Provided insights into Snowball Earth dynamics
- Contributed to understanding of extreme climate events

## Impact

This publication has been cited 1 time and represents continued work on understanding Snowball Earth dynamics and potential life refugia.
