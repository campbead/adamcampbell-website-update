## Abstract

This study presents an EOF (Empirical Orthogonal Function) approach to identifying sources of transient thickness change in ice shelves. The research provides a new method for analyzing ice shelf dynamics and understanding the spatial patterns of thickness variations, which is crucial for understanding ice shelf response to climate change.

## Key Findings

- Developed an EOF-based method for analyzing ice shelf thickness changes
- Identified spatial patterns of transient thickness variations
- Provided new insights into ice shelf dynamics
- Contributed to understanding of ice shelf response to environmental forcing

## Impact

This publication has been cited 4 times and represents methodological innovation in ice shelf analysis techniques.
