## Abstract

This study presents a mechanical analysis of pinning points in the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. The research examines the role of pinning points in ice shelf stability and their contribution to the overall mechanical behavior of the ice shelf. Understanding these features is crucial for predicting ice shelf response to climate change.

## Key Findings

- Analyzed the mechanical properties of pinning points in the Ross Ice Shelf
- Examined the role of pinning points in ice shelf stability
- Provided insights into ice shelf dynamics and potential response to environmental changes
- Contributed to understanding of Antarctic ice shelf mechanics

## Impact

This publication has been cited 29 times and represents important work in understanding Antarctic ice shelf dynamics and stability.
