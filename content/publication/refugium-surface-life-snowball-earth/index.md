## Abstract

This study presents a first simple model for sea-glacier invasion during Snowball Earth events, examining the potential for nearly-enclosed seas to serve as refugia for surface life. The research addresses fundamental questions about life survival during extreme global glaciation events that occurred in Earth's deep past.

## Key Findings

- Developed a simple model for sea-glacier invasion during Snowball Earth events
- Identified potential refugia for surface life in nearly-enclosed seas
- Provided insights into the mechanisms of global glaciation
- Contributed to understanding of extreme climate events in Earth history

## Impact

This publication has been cited 26 times and represents foundational work in understanding Snowball Earth dynamics and potential life refugia during extreme glaciation events.
