A few years ago I was lucky enough to participate in a [Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/what-game-jam)
where I got to work with a few very talented individuals. We combined our expertise and
were able to produce a pretty fun little game all the span of 48 hours.

The game [Red Rover: Research & Repair](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2020/games/red-rover-research-repair-9) is available to play. There was even a nice little writeup of our group in the [Otago Daily Times](https://www.odt.co.nz/business/digital-developers-brainstorm)

Code for this is locked away in a [private repository](https://github.com/n00begon/ggj-rover)
